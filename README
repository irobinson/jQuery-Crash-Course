This is the web site I used for a jQuery Crash Course presentation on 7.25.2011 at the St. Louis .NET User Group.

Instead of creating something weird (PowerPoint slide deck), I decided to create something the audience could actually relate to.

It's not intended to be a definitive reference or comprehensive introduction, but just a little more substantial and useful than slide decks.
