<p>So you want to use jQuery? Here are some things to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the file, reference it locally.</li>
  <li>Or, use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>
  <li>You can also do BOTH - in case the CDN is unavailable.</li>
  <li>Debugging with the minified version? Ouch. Use HttpContext.Current.IsDebuggingEnabled</li>
  <li>Put the file before anything that depends on it, but typically as late as you can in the page.</li>
</ul>
