<!--<p>The web was (and still is) a wonderful and very special thing. But, ahwile back, it needed help. Users were becoming more and more accustomed to elegant, rich experiences from the desktop. The web just wasn't there. Cutting edge web sites were providing modern experiences through browser-plugins like Flash. But that certainly had (and still has) its downsides. What about a native solution that didn't get in the way of web standards? "JavaScript? That crap? Seriously?" said Mr. Average Dev. "That's so mid-nineties." Indeed, JavaScript the language has its downsides. It is powerful, but very easy to get wrong or just make a mess. Then JavaScript frameworks started to emerge. They provided structure in a world that needed it. Powerful, compelling experiences were being created on the web without browser plugins. jQuery wasn't the first JavaScript framework, but because of its intuitive style, simple yet powerful features, and its ability to cover up a multitude of web shortcomings, it became the most adopted framework.</p>-->

<p>The need for JavaScript libraries can be summed up in three parts, a Trifecta, if you will:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Web Statelessness</strong>: responsiveness doesn't come natural</li>
  <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: misunderstood and abused raw power</li>
  <li><strong>Browsers</strong>: each do things a bit differently</li>
</ul>
  
<p>jQuery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is a <strong>JavaScript abstraction</strong></li>
  <li>Is a <strong>collection of solved problems</strong> (shortcuts, utilities)</li>
  <li>Has an sweet <strong>plugin model</strong></li>
  <li>Is totally <strong>ubiquitous</strong></li>
  <li>Has a <strong>vibrant community</strong></li>
  <li>Originally made JavaScript <strong>fun again</strong></li>
  <li>Now just makes JavaScript <strong>completely awesome</strong></li>
</ul>
