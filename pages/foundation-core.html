<p>The jQuery() method (commonly written as <strong>$()</strong>) is at the core of everything. What is it? What does it do?</p>

<ul>
  <li>jQuery() gets a <strong>jQuery object</strong></li>
  <li>The jQuery object object is a <strong>wrapped set</strong></li>
  <li>Methods and properties are available off of the wrapped set</li>
  <li>Because almost everything returns a jQuery object</li>
</ul>
