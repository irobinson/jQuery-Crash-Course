<p>Simple tip: save stuff that is used more than once in a variable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don't bother storing anything that is only used once.</li>
  <li>A common convention is to begin variable names with a $ when it will contain a jQuery object.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it's helpful to disambiguate "this" by giving it a real name.</li>
</ul>

<p>Simple Example:</p>
<pre>
  $('.image').click(function(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    var $clickedImage = $(this);
    ...
  });
</pre>
